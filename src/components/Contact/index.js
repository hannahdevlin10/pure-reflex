Following more than 20 years in the teaching profession both in Ireland and the UK, I decided to qualify as a Reflexologist. I obtained my ITEC Diploma with Distinction in Reflexology, and in Anatomy and Physiology from the Holistic College Dublin. I have also completed courses in Facial Reflexology and in Reflexology for Menopause. My speciality is in Womenâ€™s Health and Wellbeing. I am a member of the Irish Reflexologists Institute and am fully insured. Becoming a Reflexologist was the right decision for me and I look forward to the next chapter. I believe that in order for us to take care of others, we need to take care of ourselves first.',
